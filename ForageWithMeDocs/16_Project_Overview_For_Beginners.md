## What Makes Up the Game?

ForageWithMe is like a digital dollhouse with many different parts working together. Here's a simple breakdown:

- **The Engine**: Godot 4.4 is like the foundation of a house - it provides the basic building blocks
- **Scenes**: These are like rooms in a house - separate areas that serve different purposes
- **Scripts**: These are like instruction manuals that tell each part of the game what to do
- **Resources**: These are like furniture and decorations - they define how things look and behave

## Main Game Systems

ForageWithMe has several main systems that work together:

### Player System
Controls everything related to the player character:
- Movement and camera controls
- Inventory management
- Interaction with objects in the world

### Foraging System
Handles collecting resources from the environment:
- Finding items in the world
- Gathering them when you interact
- Tracking your skill level with different types of foraging

### Inventory System
Keeps track of what you've collected:
- Storing items you gather
- Organizing different types of items
- Showing what you have in the user interface

### World System
Manages the game environment:
- Different areas like forests and villages
- Time of day and weather
- Respawning forageable items over time

## How the Player Character Works

The player character in ForageWithMe is controlled using:

- **WASD keys**: For moving around
- **Mouse**: For looking around
- **E key**: For interacting with things in the world

When you approach something you can interact with:
1. A special invisible ray extends from your character to detect items
2. If it hits something interactive, a label appears
3. When you press E, your character performs the appropriate action
4. For forageables, the item is collected and added to your inventory

## The Foraging System

The foraging system is at the heart of the game:

1. **Finding Resources**: Forageable items are scattered throughout the world
2. **Collecting**: When you interact with a forageable, it's added to your inventory
3. **Proficiency**: The more you collect a certain type of item, the better you get at finding it
4. **Respawning**: After collection, items will regrow or reappear after some time
5. **Seasons**: Different items may be available based on the in-game season

## Game World and Items

The world of ForageWithMe contains:

- **Forest Areas**: Rich with wild berries, mushrooms, and wood
- **Village**: Where NPCs (non-player characters) live and work
- **Your Cabin**: A home base where you can craft and store items

Items you can collect include:
- Wild Berries
- Mushrooms
- Oak Logs
- Herbs
- And many more to discover!
