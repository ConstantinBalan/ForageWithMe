## Visual Style Overview

### Core Artistic Vision
"Forage With Me" features a charming, stylized 3D art style that balances whimsy with natural beauty. The visual aesthetic draws inspiration from Studio Ghibli films, modern cozy games like Animal Crossing, and traditional botanical illustrations. The world should feel inviting and magical, yet grounded in recognizable natural elements.

### Key Visual Pillars
1. **Charming Stylization:** Slightly exaggerated proportions and simplified details that emphasize character and readability
2. **Natural Beauty:** Rich environments with attention to botanical accuracy in a stylized form
3. **Seasonal Expressiveness:** Dramatic visual changes across seasons that affect color, lighting, and atmosphere
4. **Cozy Warmth:** Inviting spaces with warm lighting and comfortable details
5. **Visual Clarity:** Clear visual language that helps players identify interactive elements

### Art Style References
- **Character Style:** Animal Crossing, Bugsnax, Okami
- **Environment Style:** Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, Eastward, Yonder: The Cloud Catcher Chronicles
- **Lighting:** Studio Ghibli films, particularly "The Secret World of Arrietty" and "My Neighbor Totoro"

## Character Design

### Character Proportions
- Anthropomorphic animal characters with slightly exaggerated proportions
- Head-to-body ratio of approximately 1:3
- Large, expressive eyes
- Simplified paws/hands with four fingers
- Heights vary by species but average 5-6 heads tall
- The raccoon player character should be of medium height compared to other villagers

### Character Style Guidelines
- Clean, simple silhouettes with recognizable animal features
- Minimal texture detail in favor of strong color and shape
- Soft, rounded forms with some angular elements for visual interest
- Clothing should reflect profession and personality
- Each character should have a unique silhouette recognizable from a distance

### Player Character (Raccoon)
- **Defining Features:** Mask-like face markings, ringed tail, dexterous paws
- **Customization:** Variations in fur patterns, eye color, and clothing options
- **Size:** Medium height, nimble build
- **Special Characteristics:** Expressive hands for foraging animations, detail in the tail for expressiveness

### Villager Character Templates
- **Small Animals (Squirrels, Rabbits):** Quick movements, large eyes, tufted ears or tails
- **Medium Animals (Foxes, Badgers):** Balanced proportions, distinctive facial features
- **Large Animals (Deer, Bears):** Slightly more realistic proportions, imposing presence

- Warm lighting from windows and lanterns
- Clear paths connecting important locations
- Unique architectural elements for each villager's home reflecting their species and personality

## UI Design

### UI Philosophy
The UI should feel organic and handcrafted, reinforcing the natural themes of the game. Elements should appear as if drawn or crafted by the village residents.

### Key UI Features
- **Natural Materials:** UI elements should evoke parchment, wood, and natural fibers
- **Hand-Drawn Style:** Icons and decorative elements with a slightly imperfect, illustrated quality
- **Botanical Motifs:** Plant elements as decorative borders and dividers
- **Clear Information Hierarchy:** Despite the artistic style, information should be immediately readable

### HUD Design
- Minimal permanent HUD elements
- Time/season indicator resembling a small sundial or seasonal flower
- Energy meter as a growing/shrinking plant
- Contextual interaction prompts appearing near interactive objects

### Menu Designs
- **Inventory:** Organized as a collector's journal with sketched item illustrations
- **Recipe Book:** Handwritten recipes with botanical illustrations
- **Map:** Hand-drawn map with ink and watercolor styling
- **Relationship Menu:** Tree-like diagram showing connections to villagers

### Icon Style
- Consistent stroke weight and simplification level
- Hand-drawn aesthetic with botanical inspiration
- Clear silhouettes for immediate recognition
- Color-coding system matching item categories

## Animation Guidelines

### Character Animation Style
- Slightly exaggerated, bouncy movements
- Emphasis on personality in idle animations
- Species-specific movement characteristics
- 12-16 frames per second for stylized effect

### Key Character Animations
- **Locomotion:** Walk, run, tired walk
- **Foraging:** Different animations for various gathering techniques
- **Crafting:** Cooking, medicine-making
- **Social:** Greeting, thinking, happy, disappointed
- **Environmental:** Cold, hot, wet, surprised

### Environmental Animation
- Gentle wind effects on foliage
- Water ripples and flow
- Weather effects (rain, snow, leaves)
- Subtle ambient movement in all scenes

### UI Animation
- Soft, bouncy transitions between states
- Subtle breathing animations for organic elements
- Hand-drawn animation frames for special effects
