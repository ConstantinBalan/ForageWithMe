## Story & Setting

### Background
In the peaceful woodland village of Mossholm, the longtime town healer and cook has mysteriously disappeared. When a lost raccoon (the player) is found injured in the nearby forest, the villagers nurse them back to health. Upon recovery, the raccoon reveals knowledge of medicinal plants and cooking skills - a fortuitous discovery as the village desperately needs someone to fill the role of the missing healer.

### Main Narrative
The player takes on the role of the village's new doctor/cook, learning the land's seasonal bounty while trying to solve the mystery of the missing healer. As they earn the villagers' trust, they'll uncover clues about what happened and the danger that may still lurk in the deepest parts of the wilderness.

### World Background
Mossholm is a self-sufficient village of anthropomorphic woodland animals, situated at the crossroads of four diverse ecosystems: lush forests, open plains, a flowing river, and a pristine lake. Each area has its own guardian spirit that the villagers honor through seasonal festivals. The village has ancient traditions of foraging and herbalism, with knowledge passed down through generations.
